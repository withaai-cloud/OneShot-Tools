# 🔧 Fix for 404 NOT_FOUND Error

The 404 error means Vercel can't route to your function. Two issues fixed:

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed vercel.json Routing
```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/api/index"
    }
  ]
}
```

This uses the modern Vercel routing (no legacy `builds` config).

### 2. Fixed api/index.py
- Removed `os.chdir()` that was causing issues
- Simplified to just import and expose the app

### 3. Fixed Template Path Detection
- `app.py` now tries multiple locations for templates
- Works whether called from api/ or root

## Quick Update

**Just replace these 3 files:**
1. `vercel.json`
2. `api/index.py`  
3. `app.py`

Then push to GitHub.

## Or Full Replacement

For safety, replace everything:

```bash
# In your repo
rm -rf *
cp -r path/to/oneshot-tools-vercel/* .
git add -A
git commit -m "Fix 404 routing"
git push
```

## After Deploying

You should see the OneShot Tools homepage!

If you still get 404, check:
1. `api/index.py` file exists in GitHub
2. `api/templates/index.html` exists in GitHub
3. Vercel deployment logs show "Build Completed"

---

**This should be the final fix!** The routing is now correct. 🎯
